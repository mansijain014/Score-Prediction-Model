# Score-Prediction-Model
The Sparks Foundation Task-1

## Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
In this, we can see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions and how we can start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

## Simple Linear Regression
In this regression task we can predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
